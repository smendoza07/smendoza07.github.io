<p>My name is Saul Mendoza, and I am currently a Computer Engineering undergrad at UCR.<p>
  
<p>I have a passion for all things tech. After a long career in plumbing, pretty much the complete opposite
of tech, I decided to take the leap and go back to school to pursue my childhood dream of working
with technology.<p>
  
<p>This website is a catalog of my projects along the way.<p>
